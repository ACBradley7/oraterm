  text: 'As I rise from sleep, I thank you, Holy Trinity, for because of your great
    goodness and patience, you were not angry with me, an idler and sinner, nor have
    you destroyed me in my sins, but have shown your usual love for me. And when I
    was prostrate in despair, you raised me to glorify with your power. Enlighten
    now my mind''s eye, open my mouth to study your words and understand your commandments,
    to do your will and sing to you in heartfelt adoration, and praise your most holy
    name, of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and forever and to the
    ages of ages. Amen.

  name: A Prayer Of Saint Basil
  text: 'We bless you, O God, most high and Lord of mercy. You are always doing great
    and inscrutable things with us, glorious and wonderful, and without number. You
    grant us sleep for rest from our infirmities, and repose from the burdens of our
    much-toiling flesh. We thank you, for you have not destroyed us with our sins,
    but have continued to love us; and though we were sunk in despair, you have raised
    us up to glorify your power. Therefore, we implore your incomparable goodness.
    Enlighten the eyes of our understanding and raise up our minds from the heavy
    sleep of indolence. Open our mouth and fill it with your praise, that we may be
    able without distraction to sing and confess that you are God, glorified in all
    and by all, the eternal Father, with your only begotten Son, and your all holy,
    good, and life-giving Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages. Amen.

  name: A Prayer Of Saint Eustratios
  text: 'Most highly do I praise you, Lord, for you have taken notice of my lowliness
    and have not delivered me into the hands of my enemies but have relieved my soul
    of its needs. Now, Master, let your hand shelter me, and let your grace descend
    upon me, for my soul is distracted and pained at the departure from this, my miserable
    and sordid body, that the end design of the adversary may not overtake her and
    make her stumble into the darkness for the unknown and known sins amassed by me
    in this life. Be gracious to me, Master, and do not let my soul see the dark countenance
    of the evil spirits, but let her be received by your angels bright and shining.
    Glorify your holy name, and by your might set me before your divine judgment seat.
    When I am being judged, do not allow the hand of the prince of this world to take
    hold of me, to throw me, a sinner, into the depths of hell, but stand by me and
    be a savior and mediator to me. Have mercy, Lord, on my soul, defiled through
    the passions of this life, and receive her cleansed by penitence and confession,
    for you are blessed to the ages of ages. Amen.
